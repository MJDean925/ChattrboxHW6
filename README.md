Due to requiring 'npm run dev' to run the website it cannot be hosted by github pages, so the files would need to be downloaded and compiled with 'npm run build' then launched with 'npm run dev'.

When testing the mime types all the files are named 'test' but with different extensions, so when running the website with 'npm run dev' navigate to 'localhost:3000/test.txt' and change txt to match the other extensions (mp4, mp3, wav, html, pdf). The only difference is jpegs were tested with 404.jpeg.
